This repository contains our solutions for the assignments completed during the Computer Vision course at the University of Haifa. The course focused on various aspects of computer vision such as deep learning , camera geometry , Sterore images ,Object recognition:

Assignment 1: Puzzle Solver using RANSAC
In this assignment, we developed a puzzle solver using the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. The goal was to stitch a given set of images together in the correct order so that the stitched images would form a complete puzzle. Prior to the stitching process, we implemented a method to calculate the correct position of each image. The resulting puzzle solver is capable of accurately arranging the images to create the final puzzle.

Assignment 2: Depth and Disparity Maps Calculation
For this assignment, we worked on calculating depth and disparity maps using stereo images. Given a pair of stereo images, we implemented algorithms to compute the depth map, which provides information about the distance of objects from the camera, and the disparity map, which indicates the difference in horizontal pixel coordinates between the left and right images. Additionally, we generated ten synthetic images along the X-axis between the two original images, enhancing the understanding of depth perception.

Assignment 3: MNIST Neural Network Digit Classifier
In the third assignment, we developed a digit classifier using a neural network architecture for the MNIST dataset. The goal was to create a model capable of accurately classifying handwritten digits. By implementing the neural network, we achieved an accuracy of over 90% in digit classification, showcasing the effectiveness of the model.
